### A fast & lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)

Forked by me to do some stuff I need. Word.

That proxy stuff only loads stylesheets with the data-proxy="true" attribute. It hides the content until everything is loaded. It removes that blinking content.
